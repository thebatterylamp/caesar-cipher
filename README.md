# caesar-cipher
It's a simple message encrypting and decrypting program. 
I use Python 3 to build this. 
Right now it's only working in the IDE Console. No GUI has been set up for this. 
I may include a Tkinter GUI later on to make it more interactive and usable. 

How it works? :
> Asks if a user wants to encode or decode
> Takes any input as a string.
> Asks for a shift number in int.
> returns encoded/decoded message
